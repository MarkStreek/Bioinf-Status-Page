<h1>About This Project</h1><br>
<p>
    This web application was created on behalf of the bioinformatics department of the Hanze University of Applied Sciences.<br>
    The purpose of this application is to provide a simple overview of the status of the workstations.<br>
    Additionally, we created a function that shows the map for every room. With this map, you can see where the offline workstations are located.<br>
</p>

<h2>The status function</h2>

<h2>The map function</h2>
<p>
    The workstations are defined using a config file. For every workstation, a name and location is defined. The locations are made up of matrices.<br>
    Therefore, this makes it easy to make adjustments when a workstation is moved.

    <br><br>

    When pressing a button, the information of the config file is retrieved for the given room.<br>
    For every workstation, a div is being created and for empty spaces in the matrix, an empty div is being created.<br>

    The main pc of every room (teacher pc) is at the top of the map.<br>

    After creating the map, a request is made to the back-end for information. With this information the divs are updated.<br>
    Please note, the data on this page is <b>not</b> automatically updated.<br><br>
